## Kubectl plugin to SSH into EKS Worker Nodes

This plugin will provide an easy way to SSH into Kubernetes Worker nodes running and have joined the Amazon EKS cluster using `kubectl`. 

### Prerequisite
 
To use the plugin you should have `kubectl` version 1.10 and above. 

### Installation on Linux/Mac

[source,shell]
----
mkdir -p ~/.kube/plugins
git clone https://github.com/nithu0115/kubectl-ssh-plugin-eks.git
----

### Usage

You should have a ssh key pair in your `~/.ssh/` directory and you will be able to use
this plugin to `ssh` into the Worker nodes which are part of the Cluster.

[source,shell]
----
kubectl plugin ssh <worker node name>
----

To pass an ssh key, please use `-i` flag that will append the proper identity file.

[source,shell]
----
kubectl plugin ssh <worker node name> -i ~/.ssh/Nithish.pem
----

To see the full usage of the SSH plugin, please use `--help` flag to print the following.

[source,shell]
----
Usage:
  kubectl plugin ssh <worker node name> [options]

Opens up an SSH connection to the node that you pass into the command, allowing you to work faster without writing out the full ssh command.

Options:
  -p, --cloud-provider='aws': Use this flag if you are using AWS EKS
  -i, --identity-file='~/.ssh/id_rsa': Identity file to use to ssh into the instance.
  -l, --selector='': Selector (label query) to filter on, supports '=', '==', and '!='.(e.g. -l key1=value1,key2=value2)
  -u, --ssh-user='ec2-user': Login user to be used for the ssh command.
  

Use "kubectl options" to list global command-line options (applies to all commands).

#### Roadmap

* Add support to SSHing into `worker nodes` from Windows machine.
