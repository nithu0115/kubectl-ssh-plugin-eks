= kubectl SSH into EKS Worker Nodes Plugin

This plugin will provide you with an easy to use command for ssh'ing into a
Kubernetes Worker nodes running on AWS EKS. To use this command you need to run `kubectl` version 1.10+
once you have that installed you just need to add this package to the install
path.

== Installation

[source,shell]
----
mkdir -p ~/.kube/plugins
git clone https://github.com/nithu0115/kubectl-ssh-plugin-eks.git

You should have a ssh key pair in your `~/.ssh/` directory and you will be able to use
this plugin to `ssh` into the Worker nodes which are part of the Cluster.

If you need to pass an ssh key you can pass the `-i` flag that will append the
proper identity file.
